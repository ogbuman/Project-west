**THE STORY**
 
[westgate lifecare](https://westgatelifecare.com.ng) is an eCommerce website born out of the need to address challenges faced by many enterprises in the online retail space. Initially, I was working on a personal solar energy project where I was building the eCommerce functionality from scratch. During that time, I received a call from a former colleague, who described the limitations his company's website was facing—issues that I was already familiar with from my previous work in that industry.His main concerns centered around the payment gateway, cart system, and inventory management. He needed a website that could incorporate all the essential features found in leading eCommerce platforms, providing a seamless and reliable experience for customers.

I explained that I was currently developing a website that tackled similar problems, and I quickly gave him a demo of the platform. I also set up an AWS cloud server and upload the website for him to explore, he was impressed by its functionality.we then discussed on how to tailor these functionality to meet the need of wesgate lifecare 

This interaction reinforced my decision to focus on building a robust solution that not only met the basic needs of an eCommerce store but also included advanced features that could scale as the business grew.
